# MMIX System Build #

## This Project ##

This project contains a complete build of the MMIX environment.  Built
on an OSX 10.9 system.

Binaries are included in the /bin directory.  They might run on
almost any OSX system.

OSX Binaries are included in the /bin/osx directory.  I hope they run
in most OX environments.

However, we recommend you try to build them yourself.
