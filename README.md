## This Project ##

This project contains a complete build of the MMIX environment.  Built
on UBUNTU 14.04.4 system.

Binaries are included in the /bin directory.  They will probably run on
almost any Linux system.

OSX Binaries are included in the /bin/osx directory.  I hope they run
in most OX environments.

However, we recommend you try to build them yourself.
